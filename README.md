# 1. What is the problem? 

**Understanding 3D protein structure within 2D space.** 1D protein sequence provides amino acid residue information; however, critical topological information is completely absent. On the other hand, 3D structure provides toplogical annotation and visualization of domain interactions, but without the amino acid residue information and is difficult to interpret biological function. 2D representation maps provide both sequence information and 3D assembly of domains, which allows biologists to understand residue relationships and ultimately function. 

# 2. Why is it significant? 

Ig domains are an important component of the immune system. They recognize foreign antigens, bind the receptor binding domain (RBD), and clear antigens from the biological system. IgV domains are particularly important due to the ability of the variable region to bind new antigens and RBDs. Visualizing the domain folds and RBD binding in a 2D map will provide insight into regions of insertions and/or mutations preventing the immune system from recognizing pathogens. 2D maps will provide a tool to identify new therapeutic targets.

# 3. Project goals:

1. **2D map Visualization:** create a 2D map of Ig domains in such a way that non-experts can understand

2. **Overlay Features on 2D map:** utilize 3D annotation to create a vector representation of residue features and incorporate the features into the 2D map. Ex: bold residues to indicate if the structure is facing in or out. 

3. **Create 2D maps for domains with no prior 3D annotation:** Identify the key features using machine learning in order to create novel 2D maps from 1D sequence information

# 4. How to use ProteoMap?
